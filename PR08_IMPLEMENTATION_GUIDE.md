     RTI: { icon: 'üìÑ', sla: 30, color: 'blue' },
     CERTIFICATE: { icon: 'üé´', sla: 14, color: 'green' },
     // ... etc
   }
   ```

2. **Service Forms Creation**
   - Use existing Form Builder to create service-specific forms
   - Configure SLA per service type
   - Set up approval workflows

### Phase 2: Citizen Interface (2-3 days)
1. **Service Catalog** (`app/[locale]/services/page.tsx`)
   - Display available services with icons
   - Search and filter capabilities
   - Mobile-responsive cards

2. **Service Request Forms** (`app/[locale]/services/[type]/page.tsx`)
   - Dynamic forms using PR07 Form Builder

3. **My Requests Dashboard** (`app/[locale]/my-requests/page.tsx`)
   - List all user requests
   - Status tracking with timeline
   - Document downloads
   - Search and filter

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (1-2 days)
1. **API Integration**
   - Connect forms to existing submission system
   - Implement service-specific validation
   - Test SLA calculations

2. **Notifications**
   - Status change notifications
   - Email/SMS integration ready from previous PRs
   - Web Push for real-time updates
