## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner | Due |
|------|--------|------------|-------|-----|
| **Prisma client generation failing due to network restrictions** | **High** | Need alternative: offline Prisma setup or different deployment environment | Copilot | **Critical** |
| Content management features cannot be tested without database | Medium | Mock database layer for testing, defer integration testing | Copilot | In Progress |
| Build pipeline blocked by Prisma dependency | Medium | Configure Prisma to work in restricted network environment | Copilot | Critical |
| Some TypeScript warnings remain in older test files | Low | Will address during next development cycle | Copilot | Planned |

## üìÖ Upcoming Plan
**Next 7 days:**
1. **CRITICAL:** Resolve Prisma client generation issue (network connectivity to binaries.prisma.sh)
   - Option A: Configure deployment environment with external network access
   - Option B: Use offline Prisma setup with pre-generated client
   - Option C: Alternative database ORM that works in restricted environments
2. Complete PR05 testing once Prisma client is available
3. Test content management workflows (create, edit, publish pages)
4. Implement media library backend with ClamAV scanning integration

**Next 14 days:**
1. Complete PR05 - Content Manager & Media Library 
2. Begin PR06 - i18n Implementation 
3. Test admin panel with real content creation workflows
4. Address any remaining content management edge cases
